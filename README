With the release of mixer-tools v4.3.0 [1] the swupd-server project is
deprecated.  All functionality has been re-written into the mixer tool under
the `mixer build update` command. All development done around creating update
content consumed by swupd-client is now done in that project.

The swupd-server package provides a reference implementation of a software
update server-side component that generates update content consumable by a
software update client (swupd-client). Such content includes manifests that
describe incremental changes in the OS from build to build, binary deltas,
full copies of files (fullfiles) that were added/changed from a previous
build, and packs composed of binary deltas and/or fullfiles.
